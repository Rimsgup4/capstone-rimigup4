# Fire prediction model
A prediction model implemented using artificial neural networks.


# Artificial Neural Networks
It is a multi-layered structure where every node in one layer is connected to every other node in the next layer. It consists of an input layer, multiple hidden layers, and an output layer. This model can be made deeper and more efficient by increasing the number of layers.

# Back Propogation
Backpropagation is a method used to train ANNs by calculating gradient needed to update network weights. It is commonly used by the gradient descent optimization algorithm to adjust the weight of neurons by calculating the gradient of the loss function.

# Implementation
Dataset Provided
The given dataset consists of parameters like :

FFMC,
DC,
DMC,
ISI,
temp,
RH,
wind,
area
 based on these parameter we are going to predict weather there will be fire or not
 
 # To run the code:
 
1.Cloce the github repository in your computer. git clone https://github.com/Rimsgup4/capstone-rimigup4.git

2.Run Testing1.ipynb file which will create two json files in dataStore folder.

3.Run Training.ipynb file to search for movie titles across the newly created data store.

4.That's it.
